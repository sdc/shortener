* Description:      A YOURLS plugin showing the most popular clicks for given time periods.
* Version:          0.1
* Release date:     2014-07-16
* Author:           Paul Vaughan

## Description

This plugin shows you which short links get clicked the most.  It can do 'last n minutes' type reports (e.g. last 5 minutes, last hour, last 24 hours etc) as well as 'blocks of time' reports (e.g. today, yesterday, this week, this month etc).  It is inspired by the [popular clicks](https://github.com/miconda/yourls/) plugin (and others) and improves on their work substantially.


## Installation

1. In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `popular-links-extended`.
2. Drop these files in that directory.
3. Go to the Manage Plugins page (e.g. `http://sho.rt/admin/plugins.php`) and activate the plugin.
4. Under the Manage Plugins link should be a new link called `Popular Clicks Extended`.
5. Have fun!


## License

Uses YOURLS' license, aka *"Do whatever the hell you want with it"*.  I borrowed code from others which had no licence so I can't claim this whole plugin as my own work, but the lion's share of it is.
